```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
use_python("/anaconda3/bin/python")
py_config()
py_available()
py_module_available("pandas")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
anscombe=pd.read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/anscombe.csv")
print(anscombe)




```
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import os as os

print(dir(pd)) # functions of pandas

a=os.getcwd()
print(os.listdir(a))

sample=pd.read_csv("sample.csv")
print(sample[0:10])

print(sample.columns)
print(sample.info())

names=["1","2","3"]
print(sample.head(30))
sample.columns[0:3]=names
```

```{python}
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import urllib.request

r=urllib.request.urlopen("https://www.yelp.ca/search?find_loc=Calgary,+AB&cflt=homeservices").read()
soup=BeautifulSoup(r,"lxml")
print(type(soup))

# find the number of characters
print(len(str(soup.prettify())))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(reticulate)


```
